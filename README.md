# Spam Detection Model
### This project is a machine learning solution designed to classify messages as "spam" or "ham" (not spam). 
### The model uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, a neural network and a Naive Bayes classifier for the detection process.

# Features
### Text Vectorization: Utilizes CountVectorizer to convert text data into numerical features.
### Imbalance Handling: Employs SMOTE to address class imbalance in the dataset.
### Model Training: Trained using a Neural Network and Naive Bayes classifier, known for its efficiency in text classification tasks.

# Language and Libraries Used
### Python Language
### Required libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, imblearn, pickle, Keras and Tensorflow
